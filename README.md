# proposal-ppt-skill

> **The proposal-writing brain that wins pitches — and it also produces the deck.**
> An open-source AI agent skill that turns briefs, tenders, research, budgets, and cases into a *winning argument first*: a sharp winning thesis, proof-anchored slides, an editable `.pptx`, and a presenter script. Most AI tools make slides prettier; this one decides **why the proposal should win**, then builds the deck.

### Demo

Three sample pages per style family (cover · winning thesis · budget / acceptance). Click an image to view it full-size:

**premium-boardroom** — Strict grid, board-document clarity, high-trust proof pages.

### Style library at a glance

When the client has no VI, `proposal-ppt` routes to the **4 core template families** below. Not "100 styles" — four families cover a full proposal, so the effort goes into the argument, not a visual rabbit hole.

**Core families · full-deck coverage**

| Family | Suited for |
|---|---|
| `premium-boardroom` | B2B, consulting, finance, formal tenders, annual retainers |
| `editorial-brand` | Brand marketing, fashion, beauty, premium consumer, travel |
| `tech-launch` | AI, SaaS, product launches, fintech, technical solutions |
| `consumer-lifestyle` | FMCG, food & beverage, retail, consumer goods, creator content |

> The four families are specified in [`references/style-template-strategy.md`](./references/style-template-strategy.md). Any new style must pass the three-page sample gate (cover / mechanism / dense page) before scaling; styles that only suit covers are restricted to expressive pages, while budget / KPI / risk pages always fall back to clean business structure.

### Why this skill, not another "pretty slides" tool

Pitches are won on the **argument**, not the decoration. A beautiful deck with a weak thesis loses to a plain deck with a sharp one — but a plain deck never gets read. So this skill optimizes for the part that actually wins (the **winning thesis**, proof objects, budget boundaries, and risk removal) and treats premium design as the *permission to be heard*, not the product.

It is **anti-fabrication by design**: it never invents data, cases, pricing, awards, or permissions, and it never claims a PowerPoint was delivered when only markdown, HTML, or a PDF exists. Deliverables are also **objectively auditable** — see [Objective QA](#objective-qa-dont-trust-verify).

### What you get

`proposal-ppt` turns messy proposal inputs into a structured commercial proposal package:

| Output | What It Contains |
|---|---|
| Editable `.pptx` | A business proposal deck with a coherent storyline, slide-by-slide proof objects, visual system, and QA-ready layout. |
| Presenter script `.md` | The proposal logic, section rhythm, slide-by-slide talk track, transition lines, and assumptions to confirm. |
| Missing-information list | A clear list of unknowns that should be marked instead of invented. |
| Style and asset plan | Optional rich style system, font pairing, asset plan, and AI-image/HTML/SVG background route when needed. |

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Typical Request |
|---|---|
| Business proposal deck | "Create a proposal PPT from this client brief." |
| Bid / RFP / tender presentation | "Turn this tender document into a pitch deck and script." |
| Annual operation plan | "Create an annual social/content operation proposal." |
| Brand and social marketing proposal | "Build a brand campaign or social media proposal deck." |
| Live commerce / event / activation plan | "Create an execution proposal with budget, SOP, risk, and KPI." |
| AI / SaaS / digital consulting proposal | "Create a solution deck with roadmap, architecture, and value model." |
| Partnership / sponsorship proposal | "Create a cooperation proposal with packages and activation scenarios." |
| Existing deck revision | "Improve this PPT's logic, titles, proof objects, and presenter script." |

---

## Workflow

This skill uses a stage-gated workflow inspired by professional proposal production:

| Stage | Gate | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Start and route | Choose mode, proposal type, depth, visual source, and deliverables. | Startup judgment |
| 1. Brief intake | Separate confirmed facts from missing information. | Brief audit |
| 2. Proposal blueprint | Build the winning thesis, chapter flow, page plan, and proof objects. | Blueprint for approval |
| 3. Slide copy | Write concise slide copy and proof-object content. | Slide-level copy draft |
| 4. Deck build | Create or edit the deck in the chosen format. | `.pptx` / `.html` / `.pdf` |
| 5. Presenter script | Write the proposal logic and slide-by-slide talk track. | `.md` script |
| 6. Final QA | Check logic, evidence, visual layout, budget, KPI, and risk. | Delivery-ready package |

Default mode is `guided`: the agent stops after the blueprint and waits for confirmation before building the deck. If you ask it to proceed directly, it uses `auto` mode and marks missing information as "to be confirmed."

---

## Objective QA — don't trust, verify

Deliverables are checked by an objective script, not only the agent's self-assessment. [`scripts/audit_proposal_pptx.py`](./scripts/audit_proposal_pptx.py) verifies a finished deck **without the agent in the loop**:

- the `.pptx` is a valid Office Open XML package (zip + `[Content_Types].xml`);
- actual slide count (and warns when a deck is too thin);
- placeholder leakage (`待补充` / `TODO` / `TBC` / `lorem ipsum` / …) that should not survive into a shipped deck;
- presenter-notes coverage and slide-count alignment against the `.md` script;
- oversized empty "dead frame" regions (when `python-pptx` is available).

```bash
# audit a delivered deck against its presenter script
python3 scripts/audit_proposal_pptx.py outputs/proposal.pptx --script outputs/proposal.md

# audit the bundled blank template (fill-in markers are allowed)
python3 scripts/audit_proposal_pptx.py assets/minimal-proposal-template.pptx --template
```

Pure standard library (`zipfile` + `xml`); `python-pptx` is optional and unlocks the deeper blank-frame checks. This closes the loop on the skill's *"do not claim a PPTX was delivered when it was not"* Hard Rule.

---

## Work Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `guided` | You want to review the strategy before slides are built. | Produces the audit and blueprint first, then waits for confirmation. |
| `auto` | You need a complete first draft quickly. | Builds the full deck (`.pptx`, `.html`, or `.pdf`) and script with assumptions clearly marked. |
| `edit` | You already have a PPTX. | Preserves the deck's visual system unless you ask for a redesign. |
| `audit` | You only want review feedback. | Reviews the deck and returns findings, risks, and revision suggestions. |

---

## Rich Style Workflow

If you ask for a strong direction such as pixel retro, fashion editorial, launch minimal, Japanese minimal, Japanese magazine collage, oil salon, or Web3/AI glass, the skill should not merely repaint a generic template.

It first defines the Style DNA and prefers a three-page sample gate:

| Sample | Purpose | What It Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Cover / big-idea page | Tests the visual peak of the style. | The style is recognizable without reading the style name. |
| Proof / mechanism page | Tests whether the style can carry commercial evidence. | Proof objects change component form, not only color. |
| Dense business page | Tests budget, KPI, risk, timeline, or brief-coverage readability. | The style does not sacrifice legibility or acceptance boundaries. |

If a style only works for cover or divider pages, the skill restricts it to expressive pages. Budget, KPI, risk, and brief-coverage pages return to clearer business structures.

Rich styles are the **exception**, not the default: only when you explicitly ask and can supply assets or art direction; otherwise the four core families above are used. Any rich style must pass the three-page sample gate before it ships.

## Runtime Compatibility

This skill is not a standalone PPTX rendering engine — it provides proposal strategy, page planning, visual systems, presenter scripts, and QA gates.

- **Where it runs**: any environment that can read `SKILL.md` and write files (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, Qoder, …). Claude Code and Codex are tested; others are expected but not individually verified.
- **PPTX**: needs a backend (`python-pptx` / `pptxgenjs` / Office automation / a host presentation tool).
- **HTML / PDF**: backend-free — any runtime can produce them. With no PPTX backend, the skill defaults to a complete HTML deck and exports PDF on demand.
- **When even HTML is impossible**: falls back to blueprint / slide copy / visual spec.

See [`references/runtime-compatibility.md`](./references/runtime-compatibility.md) for details.

---

## Proposal Routes

The skill does not force every proposal into the same template. It routes the project into one primary proposal type:

| Route | Best For |
|---|---|
| Brand, social, and content marketing | Brand campaigns, social operation, creative concepts, content systems. |
| Annual operation and retainer service | Always-on operations, account management, B2B content assets, customer operations. |
| Project execution, live commerce, and activation | Live commerce, event execution, production-heavy work, complex project delivery. |
| Consulting, digital, AI, SaaS, and tooling | Transformation, AI tools, SaaS platforms, workflow automation, consulting proposals. |
| Partnership, sponsorship, and resource integration | Sponsorship, channel cooperation, joint marketing, investment packages. |

See [`references/proposal-routes.md`](./references/proposal-routes.md) for the full routing logic.

## Recommended Prompts

### Guided Blueprint First

```text
Use $proposal-ppt to create a business proposal from the brief below.

Do not generate the PPTX yet. First return:
1. Brief audit
2. Winning thesis
3. Chapter structure
4. Slide-by-slide titles, page purpose, and proof object
5. Visual system recommendation
6. Questions that need my confirmation

Brief:
...
```

### Direct Deck and Presenter Script

```text
Use $proposal-ppt to directly generate:
1. a proposal deck in the best available format (.pptx if editable PPTX backend exists; otherwise .html)
2. a same-name presenter script in Markdown

Requirements:
- infer the proposal route and slide count
- mark missing information as to be confirmed
- do not invent data, cases, pricing, or performance results
- output a visual system card before drawing if no client visual identity is available
- save outputs to the current project's outputs folder

Brief:
...
```

### Style-Rich Proposal

```text
Use $proposal-ppt in guided mode to create a style-rich business proposal.

Before generating PPTX, recommend:
1. proposal route and winning thesis
2. template family from style-template-strategy.md
3. Style DNA and three-page sample gate
4. font pairing and fallback
5. visual asset plan, including user assets vs AI-generated conceptual assets
6. page types that should stay business-clean

Visual direction:
premium-boardroom / editorial-brand / tech-launch / consumer-lifestyle

Brief:
...
```

### Existing Deck Revision

```text
Use $proposal-ppt to revise this existing proposal PPTX.

Goals:
- preserve the current visual style
- improve the winning thesis and chapter logic
- convert slide titles into conclusion sentences
- add proof-object recommendations
- output a matching presenter script in Markdown

File:
...
```

---

## Design Principles

- Start from the client's business problem, not the vendor's service list.
- Every slide should make one judgment and show one proof object.
- Use conclusion-style slide titles.
- Put reasoning and oral explanation into the presenter script, not dense slide text.
- Do not invent data, cases, awards, platform permissions, pricing, or performance results.
- Mark unknowns clearly instead of hiding them.
- Make budget, KPI, ownership, acceptance criteria, and risk boundaries visible.

## FAQ

**Is this a PowerPoint template or an AI skill?**  
It is an AI skill. The included PPTX is only a neutral fallback template. The main value is the workflow, page planning, proof-object logic, and presenter-script structure.

**Does it create the PPTX automatically?**  
Yes, when used inside an agent that can create or edit PowerPoint files, such as a host presentation tool, `python-pptx`, `pptxgenjs`, an Office-compatible exporter, or PowerPoint / Keynote / LibreOffice automation. Without a PPTX backend, it should produce a complete HTML deck when possible, plus the same presenter script.

**Does it require an MCP server?**  
No. This is a local skill package, not an MCP server.

**Can it use a client's existing PPT template?**  
Yes. User-provided templates, existing PPTX files, or client visual identity always take priority over the fallback template.

**Will it invent market data or case results?**  
No. The skill explicitly requires unknown data to be marked as missing or to be confirmed.

**Can other agents use it?**  
Yes, if they support skill folders or can read `SKILL.md`-style packages. Installation paths differ by client.
